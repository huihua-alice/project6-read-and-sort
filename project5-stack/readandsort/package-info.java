/**
 * Provides the classes and structures necessary to create a read-and-sort app.
 * <p>This application reads scanned integers from user string inputs, converts
 * and sorts it into a collection data structure from smallest to largest, and
 * displays the results. </p>
 * <p> This package contains these subpackages:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         {@code app} - Contains main entry and the application controller.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         {@code service} - Provides sorting logics and input parsing handler.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         {@code util} - Contains utility classes including message handler,
 *         sorter factory and sorter interface.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *     <strong>Version update:</strong><br>
 *     The application was updated to support {@code StackSorter}, enabling
 *     stack-based sorting logic while preserving the overall architecture from
 *     previous version.
